## Project Description
A lot of people today tend to use their phone a lot and don't have a good and healthy lifestyle. This problem is also more prevalent with kids and teens in which they are more easily distracted with social media and games, thus we want to give an easy way to check their health and give them tips and advice in order to improve their lifestyle. Our project's purpose is to check user's health and give them a rough estimate on how healthy their body is and open a discussion forum where people can share their stories and ask questions regarding health to achieve the perfect healthy lifestyle.
